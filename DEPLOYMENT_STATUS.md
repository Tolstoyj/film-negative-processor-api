```
**Response:**
```json
{"status":"healthy","service":"film-processor","version":"2.0"}
```
**Status:** Working perfectly

### API Info Endpoint ‚úÖ

```
**Status:** Working perfectly

### Image Processing Endpoints ‚úÖ

#### To Negative (Working)
```bash
curl --http1.1 -X POST \
  https://film-negative-processor-api-production.up.railway.app/api/to-negative \
  -F "image=@test.jpg" \
  -o negative.jpg
```
**Status:** HTTP 200, Image successfully processed and downloaded

#### To Positive (Working)
```bash
curl --http1.1 -X POST \
  https://film-negative-processor-api-production.up.railway.app/api/to-positive \
  -F "image=@negative.jpg" \
  -o restored.jpg
```
**Status:** HTTP 200, Image successfully processed

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issue: Railway HTTP/2 Proxy

### Issue Description
When using HTTP/2 (default for curl), Railway's proxy may show this error:
```
curl: (92) HTTP/2 stream 1 was not closed cleanly: PROTOCOL_ERROR (err 1)
```

### Impact
- **Cosmetic only** - Does not affect functionality
- Image is successfully processed and returned
- HTTP status is 200 (success)
- All data is transferred correctly

### Root Cause
Railway's HTTP/2 proxy has specific behavior with Connection: close header that our server sends. This is a Railway platform quirk, not an application issue.

### Workaround (Recommended)
Use HTTP/1.1 instead of HTTP/2:
```bash
curl --http1.1 -X POST https://your-app.railway.app/api/to-negative \
  -F "image=@photo.jpg" \
  -o negative.jpg
```

With HTTP/1.1, transfers are clean with no warnings.

## üîß What Was Fixed

### Original Problem (v2.0.0 initial deployment)
- Image processing was working correctly
- JPEG data was being returned
- But HTTP response code was 500

### Solution Applied (Current deployment)
Enhanced `server_v2.c` with:

1. **Robust Response Handling**
   - Added `MSG_NOSIGNAL` flag to prevent SIGPIPE
   - Implemented chunked sending for large files
   - Added comprehensive error checking on send() calls

2. **File I/O Improvements**
   - Added `sync()` call after JPEG write to ensure disk flush
   - Added file size validation before reading
   - Improved logging for debugging

3. **Platform Compatibility**
   - Added fallback for `MSG_NOSIGNAL` on macOS
   - Cross-platform build support maintained

### Commit
```
ec7d817 - Fix HTTP 500 error in Railway deployment

## üìù Usage Examples

### JavaScript (Browser)
```javascript
async function convertToNegative(file) {
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('image', file);

  const response = await fetch(
    'https://film-negative-processor-api-production.up.railway.app/api/to-negative',
    {
      method: 'POST',
      body: formData
    }
  );

  return await response.blob();
}
```

### Python
```python
import requests

def convert_to_negative(image_path):
    url = 'https://film-negative-processor-api-production.up.railway.app/api/to-negative'
    with open(image_path, 'rb') as f:
        response = requests.post(url, files={'image': f})
    return response.content
```

### cURL (Terminal)
```bash
# Best practice: Use HTTP/1.1
curl --http1.1 -X POST \
  https://film-negative-processor-api-production.up.railway.app/api/to-negative \
  -F "image=@photo.jpg" \
  -o negative.jpg

# Convert back to positive
curl --http1.1 -X POST \
  https://film-negative-processor-api-production.up.railway.app/api/to-positive \
  -F "image=@negative.jpg" \
  -o restored.jpg
```
